Hello to the world from my new site. I find it easy to build new blogs, yet I'm constantly struggling to actually use them. My goal is to write more in the coming academic year, as I prepare for my final full year at Middlebury College.

I'd like to use this more and I'd like to it be more modular than my previous attempts at creating a blog. As a result, I've switched to using a [Jekyll-powered](http://jekyllrb.com) site.

Hopefully, I'll stick with this site and I won't be forced to do a complete redesign every 4 months like I usually do.
