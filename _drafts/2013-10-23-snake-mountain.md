My parents came to visit two weekends ago and in their time away from suburban Boston, we seized the opportunity to climb one of the more scenic hikes around Middlebury. Snake Mountain features a large cement foundation from The Grand View Hotel that used to rest on at the summit of this 1,287 ft. tall peak.

For a 45-minute hike, the view over the Adirondacks is pretty spectacular.
